YOLOX (YOLOl eXtended) is a programming language used to make coding YOLOL easier, faster, and modular.

YOLOX is written in a similar manner to C and compiles directly into YOLOL.
YOLOX is case sensitive, unlike YOLOL.
YOLOX can make variables strict in terms of typing.
YOLOX adds new features to the langauge, including subroutines, loops, mutability, and casting.
YOLOX also introduces data structures and object-oriented programming, with pre-build data structure for in-game devices.

YOLOX also has multiple levels of optimization to run YOLOX code as fast as possible.
